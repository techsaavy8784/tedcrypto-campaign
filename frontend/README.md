# Node Monitor - UI

Simple UI to manage your node monitoring configurations and monitor.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment variables

| Name               | Description        | Default value         |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| REACT_APP_API_HOST | The URL of the API | http://localhost:3000 |

You should use the `useEnvStore` to work with environment variables. Although they fallback
to the .env file, they are not available in the production environment until whitelisted
and added to the container environment

### Development

React will automatically load `.env.local` or `.env` files in the root of the project.
Environment variables need to be prefixed with REACT_APP_. But in production we use them
without the prefix.

### Production

To use on-demand environment variables in production we use the env.ts file. This file is generated by 
automatically when the docker container starts using a custom entrypoint.

Environment variables need to be whitelisted in the entrypoint.sh file.
